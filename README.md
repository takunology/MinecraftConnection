MinecraftConnection is a library for sending commands via RCON using C# to help you learn and automate your programming. It can be run on a vanilla server as well as a Spigot server, including plugins. Before running the program, you need to start a Minecraft server that allows RCON connections.

# 1. Preparation
First, download the Minecraft Server software and run it in any game directory. A server configuration file called `server.properties` will be created. Specify the password and port number for the RCON connection, and enable the connection.

Configuration example :

```
rcon.port=25575
rcon.password=minecraft
enable-rcon=true
```

After adding it save the file and restart the server.   Launch Minecraft launcher and log in to the server. </br>

# 2. Create Project
This library is intended for `.NET Standard 2.1` and above. This section describes how to create a .NET 6 console application. 

Install `MinecraftConnection` with the NuGet package manager, or run the following command in the package manager console. 

```
Install-Package MinecraftConnection
```

Detail：https://www.nuget.org/packages/MinecraftConnection
</br>

# 3. Sample programs
To run the program, start Minecraft Server and Minecraft itself (already logged in to the server). </br>
Top-level statements are used here.

### 3.1 Set the time to 0

```cs
using MinecraftConnection;

// IP address or DNS name.
string address = "127.0.0.1";
ushort port = 25575;
string pass = "minecraft";
MinecraftCommands command = new MinecraftCommands(address, port, pass);

command.TimeSet(0);
```
</br>

### 3.2 Set off fireworks

```cs
using MinecraftConnection;
using MinecraftConnection.Entity;

string address = "127.0.0.1";
ushort port = 25575;
string pass = "minecraft";
MinecraftCommands command = new MinecraftCommands(address, port, pass);

// Define the coordinates at which you want to launch
Position pos = new Position(-516, 64, -205);
// Make a fireworks
Fireworks fireworks = new Fireworks()
{
    LifeTime = 30, // Time to explosion
    Type = FireworkType.LargeBall, // Fireworks type
    Colors = FireworkOption.RandomColor(), // Fireworks color (RandomColor() is get random color)
    FadeColors = new List<FireworkColors> { FireworkColors.WHITE }, // after explosion color
};
// Set off fireworks at defined position
command.SetOffFireworks(pos, fireworks);
```

Result :

Various fireworks can be set off depending on your ingenuity. If you would like to try it, please refer to this page.

## 4. Caution
The stop command is disabled due to the risk of stopping the server by RCON remote control. Executing the stop command in SendCommand method will raise an exception.
